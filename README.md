# ü¶∑ Oral Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

A web-based deep learning application for early detection of **oral cancer** using image classification. This tool allows users to upload oral cavity images and instantly receive predictions ‚Äî **Benign** or **Malignant** ‚Äî using a trained deep learning model. It aims to support cancer awareness, preliminary screening, and early intervention.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** This is not a diagnostic tool. It is intended for educational and research purposes only. Always consult medical professionals for clinical advice.

## üöÄ Features

- Upload oral cavity images via an intuitive UI.
- Predicts "Benign" or "Malignant" using a CNN / **EfficientNetB0** model.
- Lightweight Flask backend with real-time inference.
- Preprocessing and training notebooks included.
- Uses class weighting to address data imbalance.
- Includes demo images for UI (from Unsplash and Pexels).
- Gives accuracy of **98%.**
