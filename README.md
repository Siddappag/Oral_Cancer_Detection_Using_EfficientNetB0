# ü¶∑ Oral Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

A web-based deep learning application for early detection of **oral cancer** using image classification. This tool allows users to upload oral cavity images and instantly receive predictions ‚Äî **Benign** or **Malignant** ‚Äî using a trained deep learning model. It aims to support cancer awareness, preliminary screening, and early intervention.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** This is not a diagnostic tool. It is intended for educational and research purposes only. Always consult medical professionals for clinical advice.
